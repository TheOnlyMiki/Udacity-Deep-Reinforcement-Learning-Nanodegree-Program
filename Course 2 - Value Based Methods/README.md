# Dependencies

This is an amended version of the `python/` folder from the [ML-Agents repository](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents).  It has been edited to include a few additional pip packages needed for the Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree program.

# Project Details

I attempted to train the agent in my environment but encountered issues. 

Initially, I installed the latest version of Anaconda (Python 3.12) and followed the course instructions, but Python 3.6 was inactive in my environment. 

I then tried reinstalling an older version of Anaconda, which defaults to Python 3.6. 

However, even after registering it, Anaconda was not recognized in my environment path.

Therefore, the only way I can proceed with this project is by using Udacityâ€™s workspace.
