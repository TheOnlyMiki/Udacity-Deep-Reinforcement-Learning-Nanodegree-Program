# Dependencies

This is an amended version of the `python/` folder from the [ML-Agents repository](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents).  It has been edited to include a few additional pip packages needed for the Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree program.


# Project Details

### Unity ML-agents tennis environment

In this environment, two agents control rackets to bounce a ball over a net. If an agent hits the ball over the net, it receives a reward of +0.1. If an agent lets a ball hit the ground or hits the ball out of bounds, it receives a reward of -0.01. Thus, the goal of each agent is to keep the ball in play.

The observation space consists of 8 variables corresponding to the position and velocity of the ball and racket. Each agent receives its own, local observation. Two continuous actions are available, corresponding to movement toward (or away from) the net, and jumping.

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agents must get an average score of +0.5 (over 100 consecutive episodes, after taking the maximum over both agents). Specifically,

- After each episode, we add up the rewards that each agent received (without discounting), to get a score for each agent. This yields 2 (potentially different) scores. We then take the maximum of these 2 scores.
- This yields a single score for each episode.

The environment is considered solved, when the average (over 100 episodes) of those scores is at least +0.5.


# Getting Started

### Step 1: Activate the Environment

Follow the instructions in the [DRLND GitHub repository](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning#dependencies) to set up your Python environment. These instructions can be found in README.md at the root of the repository. By following these instructions, you will install PyTorch, the ML-Agents toolkit, and a few more Python packages required to complete the project.

(For Windows users) The ML-Agents toolkit supports Windows 10. While it might be possible to run the ML-Agents toolkit using other versions of Windows, it has not been tested on other versions. Furthermore, the ML-Agents toolkit has not been tested on a Windows VM such as Bootcamp or Parallels.


### Step 2: Download the Unity Environment

For this project, you will not need to install Unity - this is because we have already built the environment for you, and you can download it from one of the links below. You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:

# Instructions

I attempted to train the agent in my environment but encountered issues. 

Initially, I installed the latest version of Anaconda (Python 3.12) and followed the course instructions, but Python 3.6 was inactive in my environment. 

I then tried reinstalling an older version of Anaconda, which defaults to Python 3.6. However, even after registering it, Anaconda (older version) was not recognized in my environment path.

Therefore, the only way I can proceed with this project is by using Udacityâ€™s workspace.
